       <p>My full name is Nadia Yazmin Ramirez. Most call me Nadia. I’m the artist behind Yazmin Designz. I believe every experience is a journey to a new adventure. As a high school
sophomore, both a Visual Arts and Digital Communications major at Cab Calloway School of the Arts, I consider myself an artistic explorer. In my expeditions thus far, I have found a love of traveling, art, communications and being backstage.</p>
